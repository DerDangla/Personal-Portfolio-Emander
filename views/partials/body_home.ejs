            <h4><i>
                My mission is to be able to apply analytic thinking to problems and find a <br>
                practical solution that has a lasting value and isn’t a quick fix. <br>
                As a student, I keep the beginners mind by experimenting without the fear <br>
                of failure. There will always be things I have to learn and mistakes to <br>
                come accross, which develops me.

                <h5><p>
                    The little prince is a simple tale that tells the story of a child who travels the universe gaining wisdom.<br><br>
                    
                    This book continue to makes sense as I re-read it and grow older. This is not a children book. This book is for adults who feel nostalgia for the simple comfort of childhood innocence but is aware that they can never go back to it.
                    <br><br>
                    My favorite line from this book is when the fox tells the little prince a little secret: “It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”
                    <br><br>
                    After writing this book, Antoine de Saint Exupery died when flying his plane in a war to liberate his country, killed by adults who played a game of war.
